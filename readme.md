API, Web APP and Mobile app			

Repo containing an API calling this api https://github.com/Shadowys/btapi to format result correctly for my use.		
There will also be 2 app, one web app and an hybrid app based on ionic completely rewritten from what I have already done here : https://github.com/AzSiAz/LN-Reader		

By the way my previous app attemp can still be used to read novel, my previous api to download chapter is still online and will probably be until this app is out^^

TODO : 		
	- Database      
	- Get result from Database if there aren't too old (probably 2 days, 3 max for list and 1 day for novel detail) or update database if too old		
	- Web APP		
	- Hybrid APP
