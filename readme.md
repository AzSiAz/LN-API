API, Web APP and Mobile app			

Repo containing an API calling this api https://github.com/Shadowys/btapi to format result correctly for my use.		
There will also be 2 app, one web app and an hybrid app based on ionic completely rewritten from what I have already done here : https://github.com/AzSiAz/LN-Reader		


TODO : 		
	- Database

	- Web APP		
	- Hybrid APP
